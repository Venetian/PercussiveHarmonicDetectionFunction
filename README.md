PercussiveHarmonicDetectionFunction
===================================

Implementation of perucssive harmonic detection function in C++


requires ofxWindowRegion and ofxPlotFunction

also here on Github.com/Venetian

1. generate a project using project generator and copy source from AudioInputExample
2. test that compiles okay
3. add files to project, both the src and the ofxWindowRegion, ofxPlotFunction files
4. remove ofxPlotOnsetDetectionFunction (not required and has a dependency)
5. compile

This uses Accelerate , Apple's own framework, for the FFT

Perhaps another version is required for alternative use - eg on Windows machine
